# BreakBeat Classifier

## Introduction
Music genre classifier built for CS 7641 Machine Learning. Developed by Brian Chuo, Iman Haque, William Dingler, Ananth Dandibhotla, and Brian Hill

## About BreakBeat
Project developed in Python for classifying music into genres based off the sound wave analysis. This project was developed using both unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms, requiring the use of a Deep Belief Network (DBM). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used as a learning tool for unsupervised learning, along with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for supervised learning.

See CS 7641 Final Report 1 for a full report on the project.

Python libraries used:
  - PyTube
  - scipy
  - Matplotlib
